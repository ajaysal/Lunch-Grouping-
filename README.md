# Lunch-Grouping-
Program to generate a complete set of random groups to go eat with. 
Criteria chossen:
1) No group should be fewer than 3 people (the conversation dies easily)
2) Or greater than 5 (it's hard to get a table).


Solution:

I have used an array in the code to genrate random groups by assigning all the employees for the Lunch.

Since there is no database in-place to store the list of employees, any new employee onboarded need to be added to the array to be part of the grouping mechanism.
