# Lunch-Grouping-
Program to generate a complete set of random groups to go eat with. No group should be fewer than 3 people (the conversation dies easily) or greater than 5 (it's hard to get a table).


Solution:

I have used a sample array to randomly generate groups for lunch, as part of the code I have retained the console.log so that you folks can run the code and see the output.

Since there is no database in-place to store the list of employees, any new employee onboarded need to be added to the array to be part of the grouping mechanism.

The code will genrate random groups by assigning all the employees for the Lunch.
